general information about perturbis
##################################

This programm is an early prototype of a graphical and interactive gentoo
package management application using the paludis api and is released under the
GPL version 2 license.

I have written this programm because I wanted to learn qt programming and getting
a nice tool for the next time I'll kick my keyboard out of the window ;-)

Neither me nor perturbis are far away from being perfect or finished.
So feel free to improve perturbis or my coding skills, e.g by filing bugs,
providing patches, feature requests, translating files or comments.

This software uses a few parts of modified paludis code. If a former
copyright notice was accidently removed, please inform me about the issue and I
will immediately restore the correct state.

I want to thank my family and my friends, especially Ciaran McCreesh, the guys and girls
on #paludis for their help, support and thought-provoking impulses. You are gorgeous!
