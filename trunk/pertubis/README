general information about pertubis
##################################

This programm is an early prototype of a graphical gentoo package management application
using the paludis api and is released under the GPL version 2 license.
I have written this programm because I wanted to learn qt programming and getting
a nice tool for the next time I'll kick my keyboard out of the window;)

Neither me nor pertubis are far away from being perfect or finished.
So feel free to improve pertubis or my coding
skills, e.g by filing bugs, providing patches, feature requests,
translating files or comments.

This software uses a few parts of modified paludis client code. If a former
copyright notice was accidently removed, please inform me about the issue and I
will immediately restore the correct state.

You can contact me via my developer email address at berlios:
